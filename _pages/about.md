I am a Postdoctoral Researcher in the SLICE Lab and BWRC at UC Berkeley, advised by Prof. Sophia Shao. I earned my Ph.D. from MICAS Laboratories at KU Leuven, specializing in energy-efficient AI accelerator design, advised by Prof. Marian Verhelst. 

I have published in top-tier conferences and journals including ISSCC, JSSC, SSCM, VLSI Symposium, HPCA, DAC, SOCC, ISQED, TCAS-II, TVLSI, and JESTCS. 

Before my Ph.D., I hold an M.Sc. in Electronic Science and Technology from Tsinghua University, China (2020), and a B.Eng in Electronic Science and Technology from ShanDong University, China.

Research Interests: AI/ML accelerators; Hardware software co-design; Network-on-chips; Design space exploration; Low-power design; Hardware automation; AI for chip design.
